# Minecraft-Paintball
A Minecraft paintball plugin coded in Java which uses the spigot library. Designed for servers running with spigot.  When dye is in hand and right-clicked, a snowball will be shot out in the direction currently faced and on contract, will change the block to the dyed wool colour. When sheep are hit, they will also be dyed depending on the dye in hand.
